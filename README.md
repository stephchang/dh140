Introduction to coding, with focus on Python. Study of basic structural elements such as lists, if statements, dictionaries, loops, functions, and classes. Consideration of how to apply these concepts to research in humanities and social sciences, and project-based learning. Students discover how to manage and display data with added impact.

### Project Ideas
I am interested in exploring food insecurity for my project, looking at food deserts, the use of SNAP, demographics, etc. 

### Objectives for Class
My objectives for the class include learning how to be more comfortable coding in Python, as well as producing a final project that I am happy with.
