### Summary of article
The article talks about how traffic accidents are frequent, leading to many injuries and deaths. Dr. Lixin Huang, a GIS analyst, explores trends of traffic accidents in Brevard County, Florida, as Florida is known to be a state where traffic accidents are high, as well as trends of where traffic accidents happen along the road. Huang wanted to use spatial data in order to prevent traffic accidents. He identified hot spots of where traffic accidents happen around the county and along the road were recorded. These insights informed by spatial data science allowed the researcher to make recommendations that may help reduce traffic accidents. 

### Reflection
This article spoke to me because it showed me the impact of how data and research can inform actions we can make in the real world for the better. As someone who is less familiar with using data and research, it was interesting to see how many accomplishments the researcher was able to complete with the spatial data he created and see the power of spatial data science. This informs my data science goals in that I also want to analyze my data and create a project that can inform people to make decisions for the better.
