For the assignment, I read an article on how GIS analysis was used to explore trends of traffic accidents in the county and where they happen along the road. Through this method, hot spots of where traffic accidents happen around the county was recorded. Additionally, hot spots of where traffic accidents happen along the road were also recorded. These insights informed by spatial data science allowed the researcher to make recommendations that may help reduce traffic accidents. 

This article spoke to me because it showed me the impact of how data and research can inform actions we can make in the real world for the better. As someone who is less familiar with using data and research, it was interesting to see how many accomplishments the researcher was able to complete with the spatial data he created. This informs my data science goals in that I also want to analyze my data and create a project that can inform people to make decisions for the better.
